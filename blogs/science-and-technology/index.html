<p>Before long, the sightless people have vastly been outweighed in the playground of technology. Due to unavailability of physical condition, they are likely to face obstacles in using newly-launched softwares and programs. However, along with technology development, these difficulties have gradually faded out. With the presence of Artificial Intelligence, Artificial Voice especially, the sightless people, from this time on, are grasping a huge opportunity to touch into the world of technology.</p>
<p>Artificial voice would be integrated into laptops, computers, smartphones..etc.. Every line of words, any click of buttons appearing on screen could always be transmitted into voice, along with the optimized activities tailored for blind people, they also could be familiar in using smart devices in a quick and skillful way.</p>
<p>A sightless person in Hanoi, Mr. Nguyen Hung Thanh, said that now he can be available on Facebook, Zalo, use GrabBike and order delivery through Grabfood at ease by using Art√¨icial Voice on Android phones.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, National Institute of Software and Digital Content Industry (NISCI) cooperate with Vietnam Blind Association, technical business, inland and international research experts established project named &ldquo;Building add-in tools for blind people earning income by Information Labeling - Inlab&rdquo;</p>
<p>InLab is an add-in tool assisting sightless people participating in Data Labeling - one of the crucial processes in the vibrant AI industry this time. Ms. Hoang Thi Bich Hanh at NISCI, directly work with blind people, are amazed by the capability, &ldquo;I deeply appreciate them because they are different from what I thought about before&rdquo;</p>
<p>An NISCI representative revealed, the phase 1 of the project is related to building tools with an aim to training and educating blind people about data labeling. Phase 2 would include training programs for blind people who already have knowledge of using computers and smartphones. For now, several blind people are educated to tap into the project.</p>
<p>After having knowledge of using this software, the sightless people are trained to label data by listening to a piece of audio or a paragraph of text (assisted by reading tools) in a sample of data storage. They also take part in qualification tests and classified labor certificates to be in charge of data labeling in conformity with their own ability.</p>
<p>Qualified blind people joining in the job could log in into the system, select one or more tasks on duty list. The system would base on the time, frequency, the amount of labeled data and the amount of precisely labeled information to assess the performance and determine the wages.</p>
<p>In the setting of COVID-19 complex, it has laid a burden on worldwide public health, expertes executing this project have expected to finish building experimental models for diagnosing respiratory diseases through the listening one breathe based available data label.</p>
